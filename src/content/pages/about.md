title: About
description: A structured placeholder About page that keeps the content easy to revise without rewriting the layout.
eyebrow: Profile
intro:
  heading: Intro Summary
  summary: This page will explain who you are, what kinds of problems you keep returning to, and how the rest of the portfolio should be read.
  details:
    - It should stay concise enough for a quick scan, but specific enough to frame the projects, writing, and tools as parts of one coherent body of work.
background:
  heading: Background / Journey
  paragraphs:
    - This section will explain how your interests matured into a focused body of work, with enough context to make your current projects feel coherent.
    - The final version should emphasize learning, narrowing, and repeated building rather than turning into a full life-story timeline.
work:
  heading: What You Work On
  paragraphs:
    - >-
      This section will outline the recurring themes in your work:
      reproducible experiment systems, model benchmarking, computer vision and
      machine learning, and technical tools that make thinking or building
      easier.
    - It should read like a pattern of technical interests, not a resume recap or a project index.
  highlights:
    - Reproducible experiment systems
    - Model benchmarking and evaluation
    - Computer vision and machine learning workflows
    - Technical tools that reduce friction in building and thinking
focus:
  heading: Current Focus
  summary: This section is reserved for the work you are actively building or studying right now, so it should stay shorter and change more often than the rest of the page.
  details:
    - Use it later for current project direction, present technical emphasis, and the experimentation track that matters most right now.
contact:
  heading: Contact / Links
  intro: Keep this section structured and easy to update, with only the public paths you want visitors to use.
  links:
    - label: GitHub
      href: "https://github.com/your-handle"
      note: Replace this with the primary public code profile you want tied to the portfolio.
      ctaLabel: View profile
    - label: LinkedIn
      href: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-handle"
      note: Replace this with the recruiter-facing profile that should stay easy to find.
      ctaLabel: Open profile
    - label: Email
      href: "mailto:hello@example.com"
      note: Replace this with the contact path you want to keep public once the final copy is ready.
      ctaLabel: Send email
authorNotes:
  - Replace the short bio with a clear explanation of who you are, how you think, and what kind of work this portfolio represents.
  - Explain the journey from broad exploration toward concrete technical execution without turning the page into a full autobiography.
  - Clarify the current technical focus so the About page stays aligned with the latest active work.
  - Decide which contact paths are public, which are recruiter-facing only, and which should remain secondary.
  - In the final voice of this page, explain why softness, grace, calligraphic restraint, pastel control, and deliberate beauty matter to how you present technical work.
