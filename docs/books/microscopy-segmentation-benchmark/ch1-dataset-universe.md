# Ch 1 - The Dataset Universe (Shopping the World)

## Goal
Build a map of public microscopy / bioimage datasets and why they exist. Understand the "types of truth" and establish selection criteria.

## Sections
- Where datasets come from
  - research labs, challenges, archives, benchmark initiatives
- Common dataset families
  - 2D cell/nuclei segmentation
  - tissue histology nuclei
  - time-lapse cell tracking
  - 3D fluorescence volumes
  - neuroscience imaging (e.g., ROI extraction)
- Ground truth styles
  - semantic masks, instance masks, polygons, point annotations, tracks
- What makes microscopy hard
  - illumination variation, blur, touching cells, anisotropic voxels
  - stain drift, z-stack artifacts, domain shift

## Deliverables
- Dataset landscape write-up
- Shortlist of candidate datasets to deep dive later
