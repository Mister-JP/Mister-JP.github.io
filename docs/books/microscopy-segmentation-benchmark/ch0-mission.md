# Ch 0 - The Mission and the Map

## Purpose
Define the problem statement: **"Microscopy segmentation is messy; benchmarks are fragmented; engineering rigor is rare."**

Define what **benchmark suite** means here: **not** "train a model," but **run methods + evaluate + report + reproduce**.

## Deliverables
- One page: mission, scope, non-goals
- Diagram: data → preprocess → segment → evaluate → report
- Repo vision: `micseg run`, `micseg eval`, reports, overlays, CI smoke run
