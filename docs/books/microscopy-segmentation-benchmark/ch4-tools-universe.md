# Ch 4 - The Tool Universe (Shopping the Algorithms + Infra)

Align tooling to the job description and to reproducible engineering.

## Sections
- Classical CV + image processing
  - thresholding, Otsu, morphology, watershed, connected components
- Registration + transforms
  - linear/nonlinear registration concepts and when they matter
- Bioimage IO + file formats
  - why OME-TIFF / zarr exist, metadata pain, voxel anisotropy
- ML segmentation stacks
  - simple U-Net training/inference
  - pretrained generalist tools (Cellpose-style)
- 3D segmentation ecosystem
  - memory, anisotropy, evaluation, visualization
  - baseline reference: Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter
- Visualization + QC
  - overlays, contours, napari-style workflows
- Engineering tools
  - CLI frameworks, packaging, config, logging, testing, CI

## Deliverables
- Tool landscape write-up
- Shortlist of tools for v1
